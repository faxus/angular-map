# angular-instamap

We would like you to use HTML, CSS and JS to read the Google/Instagram API and display it in an organized way. Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve this task.

Implement a small one-page application, where the user has to login with the Google account. After logging in, the user should see:
  1. Rotating profile picture at the point of user's current location.
  2. Add a marker of 10 recent Instagram photos around you within a 5 km radius.
  3. Display the picture on marker click.

Note: Retrieve current location using JavaScript API.
